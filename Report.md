# Overview

## About Certora

Certora is a Web3 security company that provides industry-leading formal verification tools and smart contract audits. Certoraâ€™s flagship security product, Certora Prover, is a unique SaaS product which locates hard-to-find bugs in smart contracts or mathematically proves their absence.

A formal verification contest is a competition where members of the community mathematically validate the accuracy of smart contracts, in return for a reward offered by the sponsor based on the participants' findings and property coverage.

In the formal verification contest detailed here, contenders formally verified Aquarius smart contracts. This formal verification contest was held from 7 May, 2025 until 18 June, 2025 as part of the [audit hosted by Cantina](https://cantina.xyz/competitions/990ce947-05da-443e-b397-be38a65f0bff).

## Summary 

Code "mutations" were introduced to evaluate the quality of the specifications written by the contest participants. The mutations are described below and were made available at the end of the contest in the [updated mutations directory in the contest repository here](https://github.com/Certora/aquarius-cantina-fv/tree/main/fees_collector/mutations) along with a description of each mutation.

There were 456 properties submitted by 26 participants that successfully caught mutations. Some of those properties are included below in this report as examples of high-quality properties. Additionally, the top specifications have been added to the [contest repo](https://github.com/Certora/aquarius-cantina-fv/tree/main/Example_Submissions). You can find the final results for the competition [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fNR_A6-KsWLqw1SI9RhE_O_gi3aU8ehvWzCIYJ9MZAA/edit?gid=1970712821#gid=1970712821).

# Mutations

## Access Control Crate

### emergency.rs Mutations

**emergency_0:** 
Mutation: Skip setting/clearing emergency mode in set_emergency_mode(). 
Vulnerability: system cannot enter emergency mode, so perpetuates any risk to the system by breaking the mitigation mechanism.

### management.rs Mutations
**management_0:** 
Mutation: Negated test of is_transfer_delayed() in set_role_address(). 
Vulnerability: allows immediate change of critical roles.

**management_1:**
Mutation: Skip setting role in set_role_address(). 
Vulnerability: role address cannot be changed.

### storage.rs Mutations
**storage_0:**
Mutation: In get_key(), give wrong key (OperationsAdmin rather than Operator) for the RewardsAdmin role. 
Vulnerability: extra permissions granted to RewardsAdmin and OperationsAdmin due to address storage collision.

**storage_1:**
Mutation: In get_future_key(), give wrong key (FutureAdmin rather than FutureEmergencyAdmin) for the EmergencyAdmin role. 
Vulnerability: full Admin permissons may be granted EmergencyAdminRole due to address storage collision.

**storage_2:**
Mutation: In get_future_deadline_key(), give wrong key (FutureAdmin rather than TransferOwnershipDeadline) for the Admin role. 
Vulnerability: Admin role transfer cannot be initiated, will revert with type error when checking existing deadline.

### transfer.rs Mutations
**transfer_0:**
Mutation: Skip ownership transfer in apply_transfer_ownership(). 
Vulnerability: roles cannot be changed, violating design principle.

**transfer_1:**
Mutation: Ignore stored deadline in get_transfer_ownership_deadline() and return 0. 
Vulnerability: apply_transfer_ownership() always reverts so roles cannot be changed, violating design principle.

**transfer_2:**
Mutation: Ignore requested deadline in put_transfer_ownership_deadline() and store 0. 
Vulnerability: The numeric literal 0 is treated as default type i32 when put into storage, but get_transfer_ownership_deadline() assumes it is u64, causing all subsequent calls to it to revert. Due to this, apply_transfer_ownership() always reverts preventing ownership changes, violating design principle.

**transfer_3:**
Mutation: Fail to reset deadline in revert_transfer_ownership(). 
Vulnerability: transfer of Admin and EmergencyAdmin cannot be canceled.

**transfer_4:**
Mutation: Skip reset of deadline in apply_transfer_ownership(). 
Vulnerability: first transfer of Admin or EmergencyAdmin role blocks all future transfers of that role.

**transfer_5:**
Mutation: commit_transfer_ownership() always sets a deadline in the past. 
Vulnerability: role changes that should be delayed can be applied immediately after being initiated.

## Fees Collector Crate

### contract.rs Mutations
**contract_0 (public):**
Mutation: Removed authorization check in commit_upgrade() restricting to Admin role. 
Vulnerability: anyone can initiate a software update with arbitrary code.

**contract_1 (public):**
Mutation: Removed authorization check in apply_transfer_ownership() restricting to Admin role. 
Vulnerability: anyone can complete the transfer of Admin and EmergencyAdmin roles.

**contract_2 (public):**
Mutation: get_emergency_mode() always returns false. 
Vulnerability: fees_collector.get_emergency_mode() unreliable.

**contract_3:**
Mutation: Removed authorization check in revert_upgrade() restricting to Admin role. 
Vulnerability: anyone can cancel a software update.

**contract_4:**
Mutation: Skip setting/clearing emergency mode in set_emergency_mode(). 
Vulnerability: system cannot enter emergency mode, so perpetuates any risk to the system by breaking the mitigation mechanism.

**contract_5:**
Mutation: Disable revert_transfer_ownership(). 
Vulnerability: transfer of Admin and EmergencyAdmin cannot be canceled.

**contract_6:**
Mutation: Removed authorization check in commit_transfer_ownership() restricting to Admin role. 
Vulnerability: anyone can initiate transfer of Admin and EmergencyAdmin roles to an arbitrary address.

**contract_7:**
Mutation: Fail to store code hash in commit_upgrade(). 
Vulnerability: upgrades can never be completed.

**contract_8:**
Mutation: Disable revert_upgrade(). 
Vulnerability: upgrades can never be canceled.

## Upgrade Crate

### lib.rs Mutations
**lib_0:**
Mutation: Upgrades always have deadline 0 in commit_upgrade(). 
Vulnerability: upgrades can only be completed in emergency mode.

**lib_1:**
Mutation: Skip setting deadline in commit_upgrade(). 
Vulnerability: upgrades can only be completed in emergency mode.

**lib_2:**
Mutation: Skip reset of deadline in apply_upgrade(). 
Vulnerability: any past upgrade can be applied again.

# Notable Properties

## Caught Real Bugs

### Pending Upgrade's Code Hash Must Be Cleared Upon Upgrade or Cancellation

**Real bug caught by the following two properties:** Two participants wrote properties that caught this bug. The issue is that `commit_upgrade()` stores both a "deadline" delay timestamp and a "future_wasm" hash of the pending upgrade's code, yet the subsequent execution of `apply_upgrade()` or `revert_upgrade()` reset only the deadline and leave the code hash in storage. This creates the possibility of the admin accidentally (in emergency mode) applying an upgrade that had been cancelled or repeating an upgrade. 

*Author: PositiveSecurity*

```
fn reverted_upgrade_can_be_applied_in_emergency(e: Env, reverted_wasm_hash: BytesN<32>) {
    let admin = nondet_address();
    let emergency_admin = nondet_address();

    FeesCollector::commit_upgrade(e.clone(), admin.clone(), reverted_wasm_hash.clone());
    
    // Admin cancels previous upgrade
    FeesCollector::revert_upgrade(e.clone(), admin.clone());
    
    // EmergencyAdmin sets emergency mode
    FeesCollector::set_emergency_mode(e.clone(), emergency_admin.clone(), true);    
    
    // Reverted wasm_hash should be never deployed
    cvlr_assert!(reverted_wasm_hash != FeesCollector::apply_upgrade(e, admin));
}
```

[It is processed](https://github.com/alexzoid-eth/aquarius-cantina-fv/blob/aa835937c15edabb2bee1728f58ca50d5972b00d/fees_collector/src/certora_specs/mod.rs#L64C18-L64C61) by a `parametric_rule` macro [implemented here](https://github.com/alexzoid-eth/aquarius-cantina-fv/blob/aa835937c15edabb2bee1728f58ca50d5972b00d/fees_collector/src/certora_specs/base/parametric.rs#L4) to generate a rule for each targeted function.
